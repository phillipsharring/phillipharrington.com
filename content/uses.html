            This is a Uses page, which I was inspired to make by several people.
            Make sure to check out
            <lnk to="https://uses.tech" blank>uses.tech</lnk>
            for a list of everyone's <cde>/uses</cde> pages. If I ever get a
            single person asking about the software or hardware I use, I'll send
            them the link to this page.

            I try to install as little software as possible, in favor of using
            containers to run stuff. No web or db servers are installed on my
            machine.

            <lnk to="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</lnk>. I've
            started using VS Code almost exclusively for everything besides PHP.
            I had been using VS Code from time to time but it's not as great at
            PHP as PHPStorm is, no offense. I still use it to edit a few
            projects, though, including this old website.

            Lately I've using Google Chrome for development as well as regular
            browsing on my desktops and phone. The rest is other standard
            developer stuff. iTerm2 (w/
            <lnk to="https://www.josean.com/posts/terminal-setup"
              >Josean Martinez's great tips on making it awesome</lnk
            >). MySQL Workbench for occasional DB stuff, but I typically run a
            container w/ <lnk to="https://www.adminer.org/">Adminer</lnk> for
            stuff that's just local. Postman for HTTP stuff, Photoshop &
            Illustrator for graphics, but I typically only renew the
            subscription for a couple of months out of the year, when
            <lnk to="https://bsidesrud.org">BSides RDU</lnk> needs updates.

            My current personal computer is a
            <lnk to="https://amzn.to/4ehRBmg">Mac mini m1</lnk>, which is lovely
            and fun. For the day job I use a sleek and sexy midnight MacBook
            Pro. I'm pretty much off Windows and Linux at the moment, and at my
            age, hopefully for the remainder...

            I can't wait to upgrade one of these days to a Mac w/ the
            containerization built in.

            My monitors are 2

            that the lovely Mrs. H bought for me. They're gigantic and form a
            huge, all consuming curve around my head.

            My desk is a motorized adjustable sit/stand number that we bought
            for cheap from Mrs. H's company when they were getting rid of them.
            It was a great deal. I rarely stand. I should do that more often.

            headphones pretty much all day. They've fixed the few issues I had
            with the old pair of QC 35 ii headphones I had. If you can manage
            it, get a pair of these babies.
