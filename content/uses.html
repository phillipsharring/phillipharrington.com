            single email asking about the software or hardware I use, I'll send
            them the link to this page.

            PHPStorm Early Access Program (although I do have a paid license
            that I maintain). I've started using VS Code almost exclusively for
            everything besides PHP.

            Lately I've using Google Chrome for development as well as regular
            browsing on my desktops and phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I typically develop on my shiny new Mac mini, which is lovely and
            fun. For the day job I use a MacBook Pro. I'm pretty much off
            Windows and Linux at the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rest is other standard developer stuff. iTerm2. MySQL Workbench
            for occasional DB stuff, but I typically run a container w/ Adminer
            for stuff that's just local. Postman for HTTP stuff, Photoshop &
            Illustrator for graphics.

            My current personal computer is a Mac mini now that they sorted out
            the issues with the M1 and Docker. Runs great.

            that the lovely Mrs. H bought for me. They're gigantic and form a
            huge, all consuming curve around my head.
          </p>
          <p>
            My desk is a motorized adjustable sit/stand number that we bought
            for cheap from Mrs. H's company when they were getting rid of them.
            It was a great deal. I rarely stand, and should do that more often.

            (I still need to say something here about the dock and the hub. And
            the monitor arms thing.)

            that I picked up in a hurry when my other keyboard died. I'm still
            not used to the layout after about 6 months and it doesn't have
            backlit keys, both of which are a bummer. I may switch it out soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use a giant gaming mouse pad that my wife bought me that lights
            up. Plus I have this cheap RGB light thing for the back of my
            monitors, which, after the Corsair ones died I have yet to install.
