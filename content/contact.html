            I can be reached on
            <lnk to="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipsharring" blank
              >LinkedIn</lnk

            or
            <lnk to="https://github.com/phillipsharring" blank>GitHub</lnk>
            for professional inquiries, and DM requests are open on
            <lnk to="https://twitter.com/phillipsharring" blank>Twittix</lnk>
            if you just wanna say, "Hi There!"

            The worst way to contact me is probably via email. The address is:
            {{my full, correctly spelled first name}} at {{this domain name}}.
            You'd be amazed how many people think I'm a vulgar, unclean, heathen
            "one L-er" ðŸ¤£ (KIDDING!)
          </p>
          <p>
            This page used to have a contact form, but I don't speak Russian, so
            it wasn't terribly useful.
