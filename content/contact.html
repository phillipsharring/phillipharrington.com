          The worst way to contact me is probably via email. The address is:
          {{my full, correctly spelled first name}} at {{this domain name}}.
          You'd be amazed how many people think I'm a vulgar, unclean, heathen
          "one L-er" ðŸ¤£ (KIDDING!)

          This page used to have a contact form, but I don't speak Russian, so
          it wasn't terribly useful.
