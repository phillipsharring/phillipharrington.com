          Over the years, I've had the pleasure to work with dozens of great
          companies and terrific people on some really amazing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working at Abre, Inc. as a Lead Software Engineer
          writing buckets of code, and mentoring and guiding the team in charge
          of Abre's main product, their web-based data platform. I love the job
          and the team. I'm super happy there.
