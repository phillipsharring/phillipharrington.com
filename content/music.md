I've played drums almost my entire life. I studied theory, ear training, arranging, composition, performance & songwriting at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA and Cabrillo Community College in Aptos, CA.

In the 7th grade I was described as a "real band rat, who will play with anyone, any time." This turned out to be prophetic.

I love music, especially playing rock music. Being on stage w/ the band between all the amps and monitors playing drums is to literally be at the center of the music, both sonically and physically because you can feel every note in your body. It's an amazing experience.

I recommend everyone from all walks of life learn drums.
