# Uses

This is a Uses page, which I was inspired to make by several people. Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's `/uses` pages. If I ever get a single email asking about the software or hardware I use, I'll send them the link to this page.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will probably lag behind. If there is something missing shoot me a tweet and I'll add it.

Some of these links are Amazon affiliate links. If you don't want someone else to give me money when you buy something from them at no extra cost to you, simply search for the name of the product.

## Editor + Terminal

PHPStorm Early Access Program (although I do have a paid license that I maintain). I've started using VS Code almost exclusively for everything besides PHP.

**PHPStorm Plugins:**

1. PHP Inspections (EA Extended)
2. PHP Toolbox
3. PHP Annotations
4. Prettier
5. Symfony Support
6. .env files support
7. Others for Docker, Node, VueJS, etc.

**VS Code Extensions:**

1. List to follow

I use [Dracula PRO](https://draculatheme.com/pro) theme, Van Helsing Variation. I'm currently using [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) for a font. It's free.

## Desktop Apps

I used Firefox as my main browser for development for a *long* time, but lately I've using Brave for development as well as regular browsing on my desktops and phone.

I typically develop on my shiny new Mac mini, which is lovely and fun.

On Windows, I use Windows Terminal open to a WSL Ubuntu 20.04 instance. For other terminal stuff I use Cmdr.

I will one day put my config files in a repo, mainly for my own use. When I do, I'll link to it here.

The rest is other standard developer stuff. MySQL Workbench for occasional DB stuff, but I typically run a container w/ Adminer for stuff that's just local. Postman for HTTP stuff, Photoshop & Illustrator for graphics.

## Desk Setup

My current personal computer is a Mac mini now that they sorted out the issues with the M1 and Docker. Runs great.

My monitors are 2 [ASUS TUF Gaming 32" 2K HDR Curved](https://amzn.to/3k1fbtx) that the lovely Mrs. H bought for me. They're gigantic and form a huge, all consuming curve around my head.

My desk is a slick wood finish Scandinavian number that we got along with matching bookshelves and drawers from a neighbor down the street who was selling his whole office. It was a great deal.

(I still need to say something here about the dock and the hub. And the monitor arms thing.)

The keyboard and mouse are a [Razer Cynosa Chroma](https://amzn.to/3stcvpk) and a [Razer Mamba Elite](https://amzn.to/3qVzzwx) and the giant mouse pad is this gaming thing my wife bought me that lights up. And there's also [Corsair iCUE LS100](https://amzn.to/3JTxHOm) lighting kits on the back of my monitors.

There's mostly zippered sleeves and Velcro for cable management behind and under the desk, plus the odd plastic/metal twisty tie. It's somewhat tidy.

## Other Gear

I listen to [Bose QC35 ii](https://amzn.to/3aRROO4) headphones for music and those pesky Google Meet calls.
