# Contact

I can be reached on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipsharring) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/phillipsharring) for professional inquiries, and DM requests are open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phillipsharring) if you just wanna say, "Hi There!"

The worst way to contact me is probably via email. The address is:  {my full, correctly spelled first name} at {this domain name}. You'd be amazed how many people think I'm a vulgar, unclean, heathen "one L-er" ðŸ¤£ (KIDDING!)

This page used to have a contact form, but I don't speak Russian, so it wasn't terribly useful.
