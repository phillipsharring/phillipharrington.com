          <p>I’ve adopted a new policy I’m calling "Say It Once".</p>
          <hr />

          <p>
            Here’s the deal: If I have a complaint, correction, frustration, or
            concern, I’ll say it once. Out loud, clearly, and ideally soon after
            the thing happens. And then, I’m done. I’ve said my peace. I will
            not bring it up again.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn’t about bottling things up. It’s about being intentional.
            About refusing to live in reruns. It’s also about freeing the people
            I care about from feeling like every conversation is a remix of
            every past frustration. Because honestly, nobody likes being around
            someone who’s constantly beating the same dead horse.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">Why I need this</heading>

          <p>
            My particular brand of mental health likes to pull
            <em>everything</em> into the present. Every disagreement becomes
            <em> just like that time two years ago</em>. Every unmet need
            becomes the <em>latest in a long string</em>. My brain loves
            patterns. Especially the painful ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            And once that starts, it’s hard to stop. I get stuck in loops.
            Repeating myself, relitigating the past, reinforcing the feeling
            that this moment is part of some inescapable cycle.
          </p>

          <p>So I’m breaking the cycle.</p>

          <p>Once I say it, I let it go.</p>

          <p>
            I’ve said my peace. I don’t need to say it again.<br />
            And here’s the real gift of that:
            <strong>I get to forget it.</strong><br />
            Not in a dissociative or avoidant way. Just... I’ve handled it. I’ve
            said the thing. I’m no longer carrying it. It’s no longer running in
            the background, demanding airtime.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">What counts as "saying it"</heading>

          <p>
            “Saying it” doesn’t always mean saying it out loud. Sometimes I
            write a long email I never send, or a text I delete before hitting
            send. That still counts. If I’ve gotten it out of my head and into
            words, even if nobody else reads them, I’ve said it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve also decided to make this retroactive. If I’ve brought
            something up before, last month, last year, even in a rage-draft of
            a note I never finished... that counts. It’s grandfathered in. No
            more bringing it up. It’s done.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">The grace periods</heading>
          <p>
            I know myself. Sometimes I can’t articulate what’s bothering me
            right away. I need time to simmer. So I’ve built two grace periods
            into this system:
          </p>

          <list>
            <li>
              <strong>First</strong>, I have up to three hours to say the thing
              in the first place. That’s my window for figuring out what I want
              to express. I sometimes need to let it marinate, to think through
              a situation and get to the
              <abr tooltip="Ruxt: the root and crux of a problem">ruxt</abr> of
              it. So what I say is focused and clear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second</strong>, I allow myself about an hour after that
              to add any follow-up, clarification, or extra sentence. But that
              add-on has to fight hard to get in. I have to really feel like
              it's necessary.
            </li>
          </list>

          <p>
            Then it’s over. That’s the end of it. No follow-up rants. No looping
            back next week. I’ve said my peace. And now I let it go.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">My new slogan</heading>

          <p>
            Some people say,
            <em>“If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m going with:
            <em>“If I’ve said it once, I'll shut the fuck up.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Also bringing back the old standby
            <em> “Stop me if you’ve heard this one...” </em> Except now, I
            really mean it. Please do stop me. I don’t want to be that guy.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">Who this is for</heading>

          <p>
            Yes, this is for me. For my peace of mind. For my presence. To break
            the pattern of rehashing everything and actually <em>live</em> in
            the moment I’m in.
          </p>

          <p>
            But it’s also for the people I care about.<br />
            Because hearing the same complaint, again and again, with slightly
            different packaging, doesn’t build trust. It erodes it. It makes
            people feel like nothing is ever enough. Like they’re trapped in
            your unresolved story.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t want to do that to the people I love.<br />
            So this is my way of saying: I respect you enough to let things go,
            once I’ve said them. And I respect myself enough to stop rehearsing
            pain.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">The exceptions</heading>

          <p>Two important exceptions:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Kids, </strong> first. You don’t get to say something once
            to a child and expect perfect recall. But even there, I’m trying to
            treat the <em>first time</em> as the real conversation. After that,
            I’ll say things like, “Hey! Remember when we talked about this?”
            That keeps it grounded in the original moment, instead of reopening
            a fresh wound every time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Work, </strong> second. Sometimes, you really
            <em>do</em> have to repeat yourself, especially when you’re
            advocating for a fix, a policy, or a decision that affects others.
            But even then, I’m trying to follow the same rhythm: make the case
            clearly once, then refer back. “As we discussed...” “Just following
            up...” “Per our last conversation...” That kind of thing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, every job has those hills you’re willing to fight and die
            on. But they stand out because I don’t fight every battle that way.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">Final thought</heading>

          <p>
            This isn’t about being “over it.”<br />
            It’s about being <em>through it</em>.<br />
            It’s about clarity, presence, and a little bit of mercy—for myself
            and the people I share my life with.
          </p>

          <p>So that’s where I am.</p>

          <p>
            Say it once.<br />
            Say it well.<br />
            Say your peace.<br />
            And move the hell on.
