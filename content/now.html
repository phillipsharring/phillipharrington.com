          <p>
            I've been at my company for a year now and really settled into my
            Lead Software Engineer role. I've been doing projects centered
            around making the whole web application better than it was before;
            stronger, faster. Along with that I've been helping to mentor and
            raise up the other developers by sharing what I know and lessons
            I've learned from my way-too-many years of experience in this
            industry.

          <heading level="3" id="full-house">Full House</heading>
          <p>
            We've mostly adjusted to life with the full house, since the
            Goldsboro family had to move in. We traded in the truck for a
            mini-van that can hold everyone, and traded in my super sexy sports
            car for a Jeep, because Mrs. H has always wanted one.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a little hectic at times, but we've settled into a routine and
            having the family around is really nice. We try to have meals around
            our giant table several times a week and that's been lovely.
          </p>

            The (now) 9 year old tried basketball for a short season, but has
            really taken to baseball since that started up in the spring. This
            summer we have him in a few different day-camps, including a couple
            of ones focussed on baseball. He's really improving.

            I've joined my good bass-player from from Scratch Track working on
            covers and original music with one of the project's he's involved
            with. Started practicing with them couple times a week and still
            playing along with tracks and practicing every day at home.
