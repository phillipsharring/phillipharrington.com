            cousin and family living in Goldsboro experienced a family tragedy,
            the upshot of which is we have a full house, now! We've added our
            uncle, cousin, her son, and 5 month old baby to the permanent mix,
            and host another relative on weekends.

            It was quite the adjustment at first, especially in terms of space.
            We reorganized the rooms around, made the garage a hang-out area and
            put the drums there, moved our "offices" to the main bedroom, and
            got things set-up in the other two bedrooms for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a little hectic at times, but we've settled into a routine and
            having the family around is really nice. We try to have meals around
            our giant table several times a week and that's been lovely.
          </p>

            We've gotten the 8 year old into the local school and involved in a
            couple of different activities.

            I'm working on original music in two bands at the moment, practicing
            with them couple times a week and every day at home.

            Sadly, the bass player for Power Child, the band I had been focusing
            on for the past 2 years, retired with his wife to Spain, and the
            band has been what I would consider defunct at this point, although
            there's been no official break-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a bummer because that was one of my favorite bands I've been
            in. Maybe it will come around again, or I'll get to play with
            members of that band again in another context.
