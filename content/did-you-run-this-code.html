              <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Even if you’re making the tiniest of
              changes, always rerun your code. <em>Always.</em>

              When I was a younger developer, I worked at a company that had a
              lot of developers grouped into small teams. Each team had an
              architect assigned to it, guiding the developers. One of the
              things the architect did was give a 1-on-1 code review to each
              developer every week.

            I <em>lived</em> for this code review. I learned so much every time.
            It was the highlight of my week at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            One week, I had some code I was particularly proud of. Right before
            the meeting I made one <em>teeny, tiny</em> change. Then saved the
            file, and breathlessly raced off to our architect’s cubicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            He pulled up my file, took one look at it, looked at me with a stern
            expression, and said - in a very harsh tone,
          </p>

            <p>“Get out of my cubical!”</p>

          <p>
            My one <em>teeny, tiny</em> change prior to the meeting included a
            syntax error, which I had missed, and he immediately saw.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that was it. That was my code review that week. I was crushed. I
            felt really, really dumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his harsh response drove the point home, and it’s been one
            of the best lessons of my career.

          <p>Yes. I know. It seems completely obvious.</p>
          <p>
            But how often do we make the slightest change and just commit it?
            I’m guilty of doing this a lot, too, but then I ask myself, “Did you
            run this code?!”

          <p>But actually running code is a great sanity check!</p>
