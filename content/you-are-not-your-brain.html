            <strong>TL;DR: </strong> You are you. Your brain is just another
            organ, like your stomach. Let it do its job.
          </p>
          <hr />

          <p>Let me suggest something: You are not your brain.</p>

          <heading level="4">Your brain is like your stomach</heading>

          <p>
            Your brain, the organ that thinks, remembers, and solves problems,
            is just that: an organ. Like your stomach.
          </p>

          <p>
            You’re not your stomach, obviously. It does its job, more or less,
            without you having to do it. I know stomachs don’t always “just
            work” for everyone, but stay with me. Your stomach just "stomachs".
            Your brain "brains".
          </p>

          <heading level="4"
            >You live <em>in</em> your brain, not <em>as</em> your
            brain</heading
          >

          <p>
            It’s easy to get confused because you experience the world
            <em>from inside your brain</em>. But you also live in your heart,
            your gut, and your body as a whole. Most of your feelings come from
            your body. You inhabit the <em>whole thing</em>. You're just hanging
            out in your brain like it’s the control room.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">Who <em>you</em> actually are</heading>

          <p>
            I like to think <em>you</em> is hard to pin down. Maybe it’s your
            soul, your essence, your being, your anima - or the part of you that
            sticks into the physical plane while most of you stays somewhere
            else. There are lots of names for it. Whatever you call it, do you
            see what I mean? <em>That’s</em> what I think is “you.”
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Upshot: </strong> You don’t have to do all the thinking!
            Your brain will just do its job without you having to worry about
            it. It has done this your whole life.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">When ideas sneak up on you</heading>

          <p>
            Your brain is always talking. Sometimes helpfully, sometimes it's
            scary, sometimes it's just... background noise. But more often than
            not, it’s working quietly behind the scenes, figuring things out
            whether you asked it to or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            People say things like this all the time: 'I took a walk and had a
            great idea!' Or, 'I was in the shower when the solution came to me.'
            Or, 'It came to me when I was touching grass! Wow, man...'.
            Sometimes it even happens after a nap. You wake up, and Shazam! ⚡️
            There it is.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">How to boss your brain around</heading>

          <p>
            Remember when I said “whether you asked it to or not”? Well, you can
            intentionally ask your brain to work on something. Just tell it what
            you need. That problem you’ve been stuck on? That idea you’ve been
            waiting for? Assign it to your brain.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step one: </strong> Say to yourself, “Brain, I need you to
            figure this out for me. Thanks in advance.”<br />
            <strong>Step two: </strong> Wait. Hand it off and go do something
            else. Your brain will circle back when it’s ready.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">When your brain needs a cast</heading>

          <p>
            Deciding that you and your brain are separate can be especially
            powerful when your brain doesn’t "brain right", which is true for
            many people, myself included.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a lot of outdated stigma here. People assume if their brain
            isn’t working right, <em>they’re</em> not working right. But if you
            decide you're not your brain, then it's just another thing that
            needs managing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've often heard, "If you fell out of a tree and broke your arm,
            you'd get a cast." You wouldn't think that you were broken on some
            fundamental level. If it’s your brain that’s struggling (not 'you')
            then it’s no different. You'd get a cast. That is, you'd get help,
            take care of it, and manage.
          </p>

          <heading level="4">Try it out</heading>

          <p>
            That's the idea. Next time you’re struggling with something, tell
            your brain to go work on it. You can even say it out loud if you
            want. “Brain, I need you to figure this out for me.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The first time I really tried this, it was because I noticed how
            often ideas would sneak up on me. I figured: what if I stop trying
            to consciously think of things myself? What if I just treat my brain
            like an organ that knows what it’s doing? So I let go of the reins.
          </p>

          <p>
            I gave it something to work on, then went about my day. And sure
            enough, it worked! The idea showed up! It wasn’t always immediate.
            Sometimes it took hours. Or a couple of days. But every time I
            handed something off to my brain, it eventually came back with
            something useful.
          </p>

          <p>Try it. You might be surprised at what happens next.</p>
