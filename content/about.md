# About

**From:** Durm, NC y'all where I live with Mrs. H, [Ashley](https://fn00b.com), and two goofy dogs, Cortana &amp; Toph. **Originally from:** Out Californeeway. **Other places:** Florida, Arizona

**Most recent musical projects:** I'm currently playing in a band called [Power Child](https://www.instagram.com/powerchild_rocks/) covering 90s alt rock tracks from bands like Audioslave, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, and more! We're working on originals, too!

In 2020 I performed with a local cover band called Scratch Track. Before that I was with Thirsty Curses for a while, an Americana garage rock band. That's me drumming on their [2019 self-titled debut](https://amzn.to/3mqi48i) on Spectra Music Group!

To round out my drumming adventures in the Raleigh, NC area, I was in a band called Merges in 2017-18. You can hear me drumming on various tracks on my [On Drums, party people, It's Mr. Phil Harrington](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ZV60vgGuLGfRYjNL1c8kP?si=c1315fdbcd7b47e8) playlist.

Oh, and - not so recent - but checkout these tracks on [Bandcamp](https://signalsfromsatellites.bandcamp.com/) from a band I was in back in 2010-12 called Signals from Satellites in the Tampa/St. Pete area. I'm proudest of ["Midnight Motion"](https://signalsfromsatellites.bandcamp.com/track/midnight-motion) on there.

**Current web development work:** Development Manager and Senior Web Developer with TalentNet, Inc.. Clearing road-blocks for the team and occasionally building ReactJS, Node and PHP Web Applications and APIs for muti-tenant SaaS platform used to manage an organization's workforce.

**Selected work history:** Cisco Systems; The Walt Disney Company; Johnson & Johnson; and even a place called Vandelay Industries (No, really. I can send you a pic of the checkstub). My work history is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipsharring).

**Enjoy:**  music, cooking, walking our dogs, movies, kayaking, hiking, art, Feng Shui, LOA, people watching, and feeling better. Father of two awesome children whom I'm very proud of.

**Blog:** My thoughts and musings are on my <nuxt-link to="/blog">blog</nuxt-link>.

**2021 Resolutions:** Update my website more frequently. Until Nov 2020, this line started with "2017 Resolutions." I'm going to lose about 30 lbs. Improve established habits, including self-care. And I make this resolution again:  drum as much as possible. 2020 was, as you know, not a great year for playing music in front of people. 2021 is turning out to not be so great either.<br />
