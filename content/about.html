            I'm currently working on material in two different originals bands,
            providing drumming, of course, but also some input on arrangements,
            and background vocals. I'll update with more details when either of
            these projects gets closer to performing.

            In 2022-2023 I played in a band called Power Child covering 90s alt
            rock tracks from bands like Audioslave, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Rage
            Against the Machine, and more!

            In 2020 I performed with a local cover band called Scratch Track.
            Before that I was with Thirsty Curses for a while, an Americana
            garage rock band. That's me drumming on their

            To round out my drumming adventures in the Raleigh, NC area, I was
            in a band called Merges in 2017-18. You can hear me drumming on
