            >My CMS is Just HTML... Kinda
          </h3>
          <p>
            This website is static HTML built with a handful of npm scripts I
            made for applying a global template, compiling the TailwindCSS, and
            minification. The "Kinda" part is I'm experimenting with little EJS
            "components" for frequently used bits of HTML. These get baked in
            during the build. Maybe I'll do a write-up on it one of these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to use Nuxt and Markdown and a bunch of stuff, but found that
            it was cool but sometimes led to annoying dependency issues.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold" id="abstract-urls">
            <a href="#abstract-urls" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"
              ><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a
            >Abstract URLs
          </h3>
          <p>
            The abstract URLs, e.g.
            <code class="bg-mine-shaft-200 text-base">/about</code> are simply
            files without an extension containing the minified HTML output. I
            apply system metadata in the S3 bucket so they have text/html
            applied to them and will render in the browser. No routing or
            anything. It's no SPA, but the pages load so blindingly fast, it's
            just as good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Locally I develop with a Browsersync script that handles refreshing
            the browser and the abstract URLs, too, which is neat.
          </p>

            >A TailwindCSS Convert, Finally
          </h3>
          <p>
            The site uses TailwindCSS, which I am only a recent convert to, but
            the notion of using it with a team and having a common framework for
            CSS is what sold me, so I'm using it here, too. It's honestly one
            less thing to worry about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than that and the JS hamburger menu script, which I never
            update, all I have to do is write. No node-sass or any other junk
            just to slap together some HTML. It's refreshing.
          </p>

            >Hosting is Just S3
          </h3>
          <p>
            The site is served from an AWS S3 bucket with a CloudFront
            distribution in front of it, which is why the pages load so
            blindingly fast. I use AWS for the SSL certificate and domain name,
            too. No server-side junk. No container.
