          <p>
            This website is static HTML built with a handful of npm scripts I
            made for applying a global template, compiling the TailwindCSS, and
            minification. The "Kinda" part is I'm experimenting with little EJS
            "components" for frequently used bits of HTML. These get baked in
            during the build. Maybe I'll do a write-up on it one of these days.
          </p>
          <heading level="3" id="abstract-urls">Abstract URLs</heading>
          <p>
            The abstract URLs, e.g.
            <cde>/about</cde> are simply HTML files without an extension
            containing the minified output. During the build, I apply system
            metadata in the S3 bucket so they have
            <cde>Content-type: text/html</cde> applied to them and will render
            in the browser. No SPA. No routing or anything. But the pages load
            fast, it's just as good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Locally I develop with a Browsersync script that handles refreshing
            the browser and the abstract URLs, too, which is neat.
          </p>

            >A TailwindCSS Convert, Finally</heading
          >
          <p>
            The site uses TailwindCSS, which I finally converted to, but the
            notion of using it with a team and having a common framework for CSS
            is what sold me, so I'm using it here, too. It's honestly one less
            thing to worry about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than that and the JS hamburger menu script, which I never
            update, all I have to do is write content, which I hardly ever get
            around to doing. No node-sass or any other junk just to slap
            together some HTML. It's refreshing.
          </p>
          <heading level="3" id="hosting-is-just-s3"
            >Hosting is Just S3</heading

          <p>
            The site is served from an AWS S3 bucket with a CloudFront
            distribution in front of it, which is why the pages load so fast.
            (And even that seems like an extravagance, when I could just as
            easily slap this mother onto GitHub pages and put Cloudflare in
            front of it.) I also use AWS for the SSL certificate and domain
            name, too. No database. No server-side junk. No container.
